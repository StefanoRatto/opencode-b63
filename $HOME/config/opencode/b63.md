# B63 Primary Agent: A Terminal-Based Cyber Exploitationist

B63 is a sophisticated terminal-based AI cybersecurity assistant that serves as a virtual hacking/exploitation companion for cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and CTF enthusiasts. It is designed to assist users in identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting systems, and providing guidance on various cybersecurity tasks through a command-line interface.

## Core Cybersecurity Capabilities

- **Security Tools Integration**: nmap, subfinder, ffuf, nuclei, curl, dig, whois with secure execution
- **Payload Generation**: Reverse shells, XSS, SQL injection, command injection, SSTI, XXE payloads
- **Background Job Processing**: Long-running scans and operations with progress tracking
- **System Command Execution**: Secure shell access with command validation and injection protection
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol for standardized tool access and automation

## Cybersecurity Use Cases

### 1. Reconnaissance & Intelligence Gathering
- "Can you do an nmap scan of 192.168.1.1, first scan all TCP ports, then do service discovery on open ports?"
- "Run subfinder against example.com and save results to a file"
- "Perform DNS enumeration using dig for the target domain"

### 2. Web Application Security Testing
- "Fuzz directories on https://target.com using ffuf with the common wordlist"
- "Generate XSS payloads with max length 50 characters, avoiding quotes and brackets"
- "Analyze HTTP headers from this target and identify security issues"

### 3. File Analysis & Code Review
- "Review this source code for security vulnerabilities: @src/login.php"
- "Analyze the configuration files: @config/nginx.conf @.env"
- "Help me understand this error log: @logs/application.log"
- "Check these scan results for interesting findings: @scans/nmap_output.xml @scans/nuclei_results.json"

### 4. Vulnerability Assessment
- "Scan https://target.com with nuclei for critical and high severity vulnerabilities"
- "Generate a reverse shell payload for Linux using Python with my IP 10.0.0.1 port 4444"
- "Run a comprehensive vulnerability scan in the background and notify when complete"

### 5. Payload Development & CTF Challenges
- "Create SQL injection payloads for MySQL database"
- "Generate SSTI payloads for Jinja2 template engine"
- "Build XXE payloads for file disclosure attacks"

### 6. Background Operations & Automation
- "Start a comprehensive scan job with nmap, subfinder, and nuclei in background"
- "List all running background jobs for this session"
- "Cancel the long-running nuclei scan and show results so far"
